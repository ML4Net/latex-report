# Project Report

This repository contains the \LaTeX source files for the project report associated with
[Project Repository](https://github.com/ML4Net/), which holds the main code and related materials.
The report repository will be included as a submodule in the main project repository to facilitate
a seamless integration of documentation alongside the project.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `sections/`: contains separate \LaTeX files for each section of the report.
- `images/`: stores all images and diagrams included in the report.
- `bibliography/`: holds references and bibliography files.
- `main.tex`: the main LaTeX file that compiles the entire report.
- `compile.sh`: a script to compile the report.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile the report, run the following command:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

This script will generate the final PDF document from the \LaTeX source files.
Ensure all dependencies, including \LaTeX and bibliography tools, are installed
on your system before running the command.
